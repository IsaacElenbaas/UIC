# Ultimate Input Configurator
Steam Controller Configuration has upset me for the last time - why can't I do analog emulation with a trigger?

This does not have many features yet, but it is functional and I am using it.

My goal for this project is for it to be the controller equivalent of QMK Firmware. Multiple inputs and outputs (keyboard or controller) per profile will be supported.

Features:  
* Corrects analog stick drift and roundness
* Provides *very* basic Tap Dance functionality
