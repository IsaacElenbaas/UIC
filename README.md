# Ultimate Input Translator
Steam Controller Configuration has upset me for the last time - why can't I do analog emulation with a trigger?

This is not ready for even basic use yet.

My goal for this project is for it to be the controller equivalent of QMK Firmware. Multiple inputs and outputs (keyboard or controller) per profile will be supported.

Special features:
* Corrects analog stick drift and roundness
