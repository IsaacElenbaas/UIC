# Ultimate Input Configurator
Steam Controller Configuration has upset me for the last time - why can't I do analog emulation with a trigger?

This is ready for use for controller-only customization, but I have not attempted to add additional controller or keyboard buttons.

My goal for this project is for it to be the controller equivalent of QMK Firmware. Multiple inputs and outputs (keyboard or controller) per profile will be supported.

Features:  
* Corrects analog stick drift and roundness
* Provides flexible analog response and curve customization
* Has modifiers to auto-hold, auto-release, or toggle inputs
* Provides *very* basic Tap Dance functionality
* Implements analog emulation
